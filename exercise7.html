        <strong>A front-end developer</strong> is a type of software developer who specializes in creating and designing
        the user
        interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of websites and web applications. The primary responsibility of a
        front-end developer is to ensure that the visual and interactive aspects of a website or application are
        user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and functionally efficient.
    </p>

    <p><em>Front-end developers work with various technologies, tools, and languages, including:</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <a href='/pages/htmlpage'>
                <p>
                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language used to create the structure and
                    layout
                    of web pages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A stylesheet language used to control the presentation, formatting,
                    and
                    appearance of web pages, such as colors, fonts, and layout.

                    other
                    dynamic elements to websites and web applications.

        <strong>Back-end development</strong> means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you
        can’t see on a
        website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic,
        application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code that helps browsers
        communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.

        <strong>Data science</strong> combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics,
        artificial intelligence
        (AI), and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an
        organization’s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.
        The accelerating volume of data sources, and subsequently data, has made data science is one of the fastest
        growing field across every industry. As a result, it is no surprise that the role of the data scientist was
        dubbed the “sexiest job of the 21st century” by Harvard Business Review (link resides outside of IBM).
        Organizations are increasingly reliant on them to interpret data and provide actionable recommendations to
        improve business outcomes.

                MATLAB is a multi-paradigm numerical computing environment for processing mathematical information. It
                is a closed-source software that facilitates matrix functions, algorithmic implementation and
                statistical modeling of data. MATLAB is most widely used in several scientific disciplines.

                Probably the most widely used Data Analysis tool. Microsoft developed Excel mostly for spreadsheet
                calculations and today, it is widely used for data processing, visualization, and complex calculations.
                Excel is a powerful analytical tool for Data Science. While it has been the traditional tool for data
                analysis, Excel still packs a punch.
                Excel comes with various formulae, tables, filters, slicers, etc. You can also create your own custom
                functions and formulae using Excel. While Excel is not for calculating the huge amount of Data, it is
                still an ideal choice for creating powerful data visualizations and spreadsheets.
